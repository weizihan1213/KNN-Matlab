# KNN-Matlab
The repository is about the implementation of KNN regression algorithm building from scratch in Matlab. There are three datasets included in the project, along with three different
distance evaluation methods for calculating the corresponding distances between each test point and traing data. Also, the regression metrics of MSE for each dataset are recorded 
in the **results** folder.
